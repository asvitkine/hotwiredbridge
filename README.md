HotWiredBridge
==============

HotWiredBridge is a server daemon that acts as a bridge between a [Wired](http://wired.read-write.fr/) server and [Hotline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Communications#Hotline_Connect_software_suite) clients.

A Hotline client connects to HotWiredBridge, which then establishes a connection to the corresponding Wired server on behalf of that client.

The purpose is to allow existing Hotline servers to easily transition to Wired with minimal disruption to existing users.
